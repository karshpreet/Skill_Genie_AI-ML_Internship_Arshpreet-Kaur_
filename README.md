AI/ML Internship Project: Machine Learning Exploration

This repository showcases a machine learning internship project.

Project Goal:

The goal was to gain hands-on experience in all stages of the machine learning pipeline, including data analysis, model development, evaluation, and documentation.

What I Did:

1. Explored and cleaned data: I investigated datasets to understand their structure and features. I addressed missing values, outliers, and categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
2. Created features: I identified important features and created new ones to improve model performance.
3. Built and trained models: I evaluated different machine learning algorithms and trained models on the prepared data.
4. Evaluated models: I assessed model performance using relevant metrics to determine their effectiveness.
5. Analyzed results: I interpreted the results to understand how the models make predictions. I identified key factors that influence the models' outputs.
6.Documented everything: I documented the entire project, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. I also created a report summarizing the findings, challenges, and recommendations.


Project Outcomes:

Developed machine learning models for various tasks.
Identified areas for improvement and future research.


Challenges Faced:

Working with large datasets.
Selecting the right features and models.
Recommendations for Future Work:

Explore advanced techniques.
Incorporate domain knowledge.
Continuously update models with new data.

Welcome!

I invite you to explore the project code, reports, and findings in this repository. I believe these learnings will be valuable for anyone interested in machine learning.
